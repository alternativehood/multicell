* Initial commit

0.0.2

* Reworked actions and especially conditions
* Added more if conditions based on the cell's whereabouts
* World seeds are able to survive ~6k turns in the current setup
* Performance improvements - batching and single sprite sheet for the graphics

Ideas for the next milestone:

* Add the connector cell type which allows cross-organism energy flow

Connector may be one way (vampire) or two-way, based on the gene. FIX CONNECTORS!

* Organic and sunlight conditions

* Add water and it's spread as a factor instead of age
